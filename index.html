            </blockquote>
            <p>Manuel Ugarte a highly talented defensive midfielder known for his exceptional ball-winning abilities and strong positional awareness. He excels at intercepting passes and breaking up opposition attacks, making him a key figure in shielding the defense. Ugarte is composed under pressure and effective in distributing the ball with short, precise passes, though his long-range passing could improve. While his offensive contribution is limited, he plays a vital role in maintaining balance in midfield. </p>
            <p>Joshua Zirkzee is a talented young forward known for his excellent technical skills and strong finishing ability. Standing at 6'4", he combines his physical presence with good ball control, making him effective in holding up play and linking with teammates. Zirkzee is a composed finisher, capable of scoring with both feet and his head, though his off-the-ball movement and consistency can still improve. His versatility allows him to play as a central striker or in a supporting role</p>
            <p>Matthijs de Ligt is a commanding central defender known for his strength, composure, and leadership on the field. He excels in aerial duels and tackles, making him a solid presence in defense while also contributing to offensive set-pieces.

With his maturity and well-rounded skill set, De Ligt is already regarded as one of the top defenders in European football. </p>
            <p>Lenny Yoro is a promising young center-back known for his defensive awareness, athleticism, and ability to read the game. Despite his age, he shows impressive composure in one-on-one situations and is strong in aerial duels. Yoro is confident with the ball at his feet, making him effective at playing out from the back and initiating attacks. While still developing his physical presence and tactical understanding, he has shown the potential to become a well-rounded defender. </p>
